Destiny Reputation Search
===================

Description
-------------
Destiny Search requires only two things: a username and an account type. It then connects to Bungie.net through a series of service endpoints to retrieve various pieces of publicly available character data. The result is a clean, concise view of a player's Destiny characters.
